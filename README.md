This is an old OpenGL project I've done at undergrad. Long ago I lost the sources of this piece of Art ;) (I didn't know about git back then). I've found it again recently as an attachment in one of my old email account and thought why not share it with the world :) Please feel free to move around and fork it as you like.

> This project is now only compatible with linux (As my primary OS is Linux). I've tested it with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
